# nhl_playoff_scraper
Scrape nhl players and teams and stats and save them to SQL db


NHL Playoff Pool Data gatherer (NPPDG for short)

Use nhl.com to find current playoff teams and save them

for each of the 16 teams I want a data table for stats on each player on every playoff team.   Javascript will handle the applicaiton side but this script will provide it all the data it will need to proccess and display the data.

Grand Scope:
the app will take in a csv file with 20 player names.  each user in the pool will have a team, identified with a team name.   I will use python to take in the csv file, and add to a user_team database.  This database will have the team name and the 20 selected players for each user.  Stats will run update automagically using this python api


Mostly using AI,  have some javascript and basic python skills.  never imported too much into python.   fingers crossed
